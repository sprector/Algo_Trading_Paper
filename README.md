# Algo_Trading_Paper
This repository contains the paper and presentation for the project component of CSCI2291 (Data Science Methods &amp; Apps with Prof. Sergio A. Alvarez), which I wrote alongside fellow BC students Grace Venerus, Sichao Bi, Xiangyu Xu, and Quoc Tran. We focused on applying concepts from the class to the realm of finance, and our data was sourced from the yfinance API. Among its focuses are:
1. Using a variety of features to build machine learning models that predict outcomes related to the S&P 500.
2. Communicating the uncertainties involving these results.
